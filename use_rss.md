I have written [here](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-07-23-use-rss/) in detail about why you should use RSS and why it is effective. If you not familiar with RSS watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HNUqDL-pI8), do encourage your friends to use RSS. You can share your RSS feed with me via email - rka87338@gmail.com

Both the web standards - RSS and Atom are equally good. You can use any one of them. Technically, though both of them are different web standards, RSS is a more common name. RSS is synonymous with the idea of content syndication on the web.
