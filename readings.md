## Island by Aldous Huxley

I picked it up as a fan of Huxley. This book doesn't focus on plot much. Instead, it explores the culture of an utopian island *Pala*. Several aspects of the culture are inspired by Buddhism and Hinduism. The island practices strict population control, not through restriction, but by freely distributing monthly supplies of contraceptives to each household. Huxley was inspired by Malthus' theory(Population grows exponentially, resources grow linearly. In times of shortage, war and disease try to bring back the balance). Huxley considers overpopulation as an enemy of freedom([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alasBxZsb40)), as it might lead to an oppressive power in an attempt to bring balance.

A child's growth in Pala includes unusual practices like Mutual Adoption Clubs, where parents exchange their kids from time to time. So, a child has biological parents and several deputy parents. This prevents children from being overly influenced by a single set of parents. Education begins with practical life-sciences like ecology and applied psychology. Subjects essential to understand oneself and nature, which our schools ensure that they don't teach. 

Just like in Brave New world(BNW), in *Pala* too, promiscuity and entheogens are prevalent. However, unlike in BNW, there is an emphasis on individual relationships through the ancient Indian practice of love-making called *Maithuna*. *Moksha*(Pala's *soma*) medicine is not for forgetting the worries like BNW, but to foster communal harmony.

Another motif in Pala's culture is to teach people to always be aware and conscious. This idea is nicely embodied in bird's repeated calls *Here and Now*, *Attention!*. This concept of *being aware of oneself* is a popular concept among those who meditate. I have always longed to explore this idea in a right context, in a right place, free from daily concerns.

Huxley's deep knowledge and interest in Hinduism and Buddhism are reflected throughout the book. However, at several points, the discussions can be long and abstract. Yet, this  book can is worth exploring for its ideas that Huxley considered essential for Utopian society.

## God Emperor of Dune by Frank Herbert

I had plans of finishing all the 6 Frank Herbert's books. But after this book, I decided it was enough! Most of the book contains Leto's vague philosophical ramblings. Majority of the plot takes place in the end, but motives and actions don't at all seem to match for me. I felt frustrated, when I find that this book is considered the top book. In retrospect, it feels a good idea to stop at book 3, but since it ends with a beginning of a new era, you feel compelled to pick book 4. By the same logic, I picked book 3 after reading book 2. Hence, I made up my mind to recommend to stop at book 1. I have several problems with the series, which I will mention in a blog post.

## Children of Dune by Frank Herbert

Dune part 3 book has all the kind of action that you enjoyed in part 1 and missed in part 2. The book chronicles adventures of Paul's twin children. A lot of places, character's intentions are unclear. It is mostly characters playing 4D chess against each other. Weird things happen in the book, if you have still some fuel left for Dune after reading part 2, you should try this.

## Dune Messiah by Frank Herbert

This book was hard to read. At many places, it is wordy and vague. Online forums  were [Jagurutu](http://www.jacurutu.com/index.php?sid=6960afbf721ee245f1fc5b27530f224e) were a great aid. I am still frustrated by the fact that fantasy elements like *prescience* have played a major role in key parts of a **"sci-fi"** book. Yet, I will continue with the next part because I have more questions that   haven't been answered. 

## Why we die by Venki Ramakrishnan

I picked this book because I loved Venki's first book- The Gene Machine. This book repeatedly proves the point that a good writing on an unfamiliar topic is much more enjoyable bad writing on a exciting topic.

The book can be considered as a crash course in cell biology. The author explains different causes of aging and death at the level of activities that go wrong within a cell - accumulation of waste, too many misfolded proteins, DNA damage etc. Even though you are not enthusiastic about biological details, Venki's writing spurs great interest. I believe it is due to these 2 pedagogical techiques:

a) Explaining from a historical perspective. Venki doesn't just drop you that this fact about cell exists and was discovered by so and so scientist. He walks through all the key discoveries in chronological order that led to it. This narrative helps narrator think about the ideas in a more organised way. This should be a lesson taught to every teacher - find a way to put ideas in the students' head in a organised way instead of shooting with facts. (But a more fundamental reason for many bad teachers is not that this a secret they are yet to discover, but because they themselves lack clarity in the subject)

b) Einstein once said "*Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler*". Once Venki explains a point. He adds a couple of sentences more to emphasise the important point. He sometimes simplifies it, for example, "improve life expectancy faster than age" is followed by "life expectancy increases by more than year annually." Or he puts a useful analogy to daily life objects.  

In addition to the above, Venki makes the last but one paragraph of each chapter as a concise summary of the present chapter and the last paragraph gives you an direction of next chapter. Each chapter begins with small personal story    before embarking on complex cellular details discussion. Such good writing preserves the human side of details filled science. 

[Chris Olah once mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJigelnRBE) that reason there is friction that complex ideas are difficult to communicate from writer to the reader is that in his/her working memory, the writer has the context set, which the reader lacks. Good writers realise this cognitive load and they try to make the road smoother for reader instead of diverting them to a messy shortcut.

Another quality that makes this book qualify as an good book is provides a new perspective for an outsider in the field. As you read along, one develops a perspective of how processes inside the tiny cell has consequences for what we see and experience as ageing(Douglas Hofstadter provides such a perspective on about consciousness and neurons). Irrespective of your interest in biology, if you enjoy good writing and have an interesting understanding details of life, pick this book.

## Dune by Frank Herbert

Picked this book after watching the movies(Part-1,2) and this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26GPaMoeiu4), where Herbert tells that his book tries to convey a message about the dangers of charismatic leaders. As I read the book, I felt great appreciation for Denis V. for cutting down parts and making necessary changes to adapt the book for the screen.

Though the book is labelled as science fiction, the aspect of "prescience" makes it feel like a fantasy book which I avoid. However, it seems that Herbert was inspired by the idea of Laplace's demon - a creature that knew everything about individual atoms and physical laws and hence could calculate the future. At one point, I convinced myself that Spice could heighten abilities like making such absurd amount of computation in human beings that have evolved after thousands of years.

Reading a book after watching the movie suppress the thrill because you already know what is going to happen("*prescience*"). Nevertheless, I had to read this book to read the next part so that I get the interesting message that Herbert wanted to convey.

## How to Change your Mind by Michael Pollan

An interesting topic for people in psychology is "altered state of mind." Accounts of it in diseased states are explored well in Oliver Sacks' *Hallucinations*. Aldous Huxley's *Doors of Perception* is one of the best personal accounts of achieving an altered state through a substance.

In this book, Pollan covers the literature of Psychedelics in all 3 aspects - historic, scientific, personal accounts. In historical part, he discusses different psychedelic substances were discovered, how scientists saw the potential to cure mental health diseases or over death anxiety in terminally ill patients with these, how some people saw it as a way to unlock human potential and elevate human society. Lastly, how one man(Timothy Leary) could be held responsible for these substances becoming anti-culture. A laudable thing about Pollan is that his writing covers different aspects of an argument(like it was not Leary's fault completely!). 

In the scientific part, Pollan explores the neural correlates of psychedelics' famous effect  ego-death. The other fascinating part of this book is author's personal trips on different substances. In each of his trip, he sees his family emotions amplified and you come across funny things like watching the hollow mask illusion while high.

If you have read Huxley's Doors of Perception, this book should be definitely on your list!

## The Hitchiker's guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams

The reading experience would have been much more fun if I wasn't aware of the best parts of the book like planet's destruction, 42 and Heart of Gold. A short book worth reading. A couple of disappointments - a)at places, complex sci-fi words were used without much explanation b)I feel there are jokes in the book require a peculiar thought process to understand them. Such jokes are hard to appreciate without any hint given to the reader. For example, see the [digital watches joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/63i028/douglas_adams_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy/).    

## Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy

An overrated classic. The book has a natural storyline depicting the inner conflicts of a woman(probably narcissistic?) who ends up in an affair. But there are several long pieces of text, that had zero contribution to the story and hamper the reading experience. 

## Genius Makers by Cade Metz

Ideas that change the course of history mostly face an early resistance from the community. It requires huge intellectual courage to work on the ideas at a time, when majority in the field find it silly and unpromising. James Gleick captures one such narrative in his book "Chaos", chronicling the  evolution of Non-Linear dynamics. Genius Makers by Cade Metz is another such book. A book about the rise of AI, more specifically deep learning. Starting from Rosenblatt's perceptron to Google's BERT Language model, the book covers historic moments in the field of AI and stories of people behind it.

Note that books like these are not just about technologies and ideas, but also the people behind them. It is interesting to see how the big names in the field had started their journey that was so different what they would achieve. As we are being bombarded with AI achievements, I think it is the right time to read this book before a sequel comes out. (This book doesn't have anything about GPT!) 

## A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins

Jeff Hawkins is an entrepreneur-turned-self-taught neuroscientist, who built a company named "Numenta" to understand the workings of neocortex, the component of our brain responsible for higher cognitive tasks. He wrote 'A thousand brains' book to explain his work and ideas about the neocortex to the general public. 

While the first half of this book has many bold ideas, I found myself sceptical of them as they lacked experimental evidence. Although Jeff and his colleagues have produced journal papers to support their work, those papers provide a computational model built on basis of their ideas. I am not against computational model work, but with a play of parameters and many assumptions can lead to a model that aligns with researcher's expectations but not objective reality.  

I believe that a genuine testament to a theory's validity lies either in experimental evidence or its tangible application. A good example of the latter is ChatGPT. You don't need any benchmark tests to show that the billion parameter model is good. People buy it and use it in their day-to-day life because it adds value. It is useful!. In Ilya Sutskever's works, *usefulness is the best metric*.

The latter half of the book contains interesting futuristic discussions about preserving human knowledge and extraterrestrial communication. Hawkins suggests some new ideas humans might convey a message in space, that other forms of life can decipher. While I came for the brain theories, I liked this part of the book!

## Double by Fyodor Dostoevsky

A short story written by Dostoevsky three years before his exile. While I have always been an admirer of Dostoevsky's work, I didn't enjoy this one. The events surround protagonist's double and story's conclusion were hard to reconcile. The writing style contrasts from his other popular works like Notes from Underground, where Dostoevsky masterfully dissects a man's thoughts. I felt 'The Double' lacked that. Maybe this one requires a re-reading to get a clearer perspective, but I feel like revisiting "Notes from underground" to experience the Dostoevsky I cherish.  

## Gene Machine by Venki Ramakrishnan

The book chronicles the journey of Venki Ramakrishnan from a graduate student in theoretical physics to a Nobel Prize-winning Ribosome structural biologist. This book is an essential reading for anyone involved in research for two  reasons. Firstly, it offers valuable insights into the inner workings of effective scientific research, including the work culture at MRC London Institute (home to 12 Nobel laureates, including Watson and Crick), the significance of an enthusiastic work environment, and how top researchers select their problems to work on, as well as the role of luck. Secondly, as a personal account of Ramakrishnan's journey, the book exposes the insecurities that even the best researchers face, making it relatable and reassuring for others in the field. Although the book contains substantial structural biology content, readers from diverse backgrounds will still be able to appreciate and enjoy the narrative.

## Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks

I have always been captivated by the diverse experiences that the human brain can generate, and this book offers a plethora of such instances. On a personal level, this book has reinforced my belief that ultimately the underlying physiology dictates an individual’s experiences and behaviours. Full blog post [here](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2023-05-08-Hallucinations-review/)

## The Elephant in the Brain by Simler and Hanson

This book can be summarized with the quote - *A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and a real reason.* The book talks about the hidden motives behind our actions. Hidden motives as in not just unknown to other people, but also to you(your consciousness). Through evolution, our brains have learnt to deceive ourselves before deceiving others. This is perfect for survival because if you are unaware of it, then you won't express it and your real selfish motive will remain hidden. Any Freud fan would surely be attracted to such an idea that explores the unconscious side of the brain.

This first part of this book does a great job in explaining how such a self-deception came into existence and why it is necessary for survival. The second part of the book explore implications of this idea in large scale institutions like Education, Politics, Religion, Medicine, Art. The book uncovers the hidden motives by showing the discrepancy between the apparent intention and action. These discussions are also backed by evolutionary arguments and experiments on animals. I was really impressed by this aspect of the book. 

This is an interesting book explaining one of the less explored aspects of human nature. Reading this might help to highten your self-perception. 

## The Trial by Franz Kafka

Despite being unfinished, Kafka's novels have a great popularity. To understand the true legacy of Kafka, I picked up this book(this is my 3rd Kafka book. After Metamorphosis and Amerika). A sense of guilt still haunts me for not having understood Kafka's celebrated genius in all of his books. The book has a good start, but over time, I felt chapters ended abruptly and many scenes were unnecessary. May be it requires more patience, skill and literary intelligence to appreciate Kafka and his work.  

## Black Swan by N. N. Taleb

A wonderful reading experience! The book deals with randomness and human perception of it. One can find many good discussions on broad range of topics(yet related to central theme of the book) like human bias, career advice, philosophy, baloney, Gaussian curve. The most important effect of this book is that it tries to make the reader aware of one's own limitations(***anti-library,narrative fallacy,ludic fallacy,epistemic arrogance, Popper's disproving, effect of the unseen, GIF, Locke's madman, END(Evidence of No Disease) and NED(No Evidence of Disease), mediocristan vs extremistan*** ) and teaches to accept the key role of uncertainty(***Black swans***) and if possible try to take advantage of it(***barbell strategy, Appelles the painter,stochastic tinkering, practitioner, empiricist***). 

Many words marked in bold are the things that will hit you hard when you read the book.

## The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin

An important take away for me from the book is with discipline and meticulous planning, how one can improve one's character(chapter - Plan for attaining Moral Perfection). I picked up this book when I came across Franklin's efforts to improve his elegance in writing, mentioned in the book Peak(one of the most important Psychology books in my opinion).  At places, some witty insights like these are enjoyable

> A  man being sometimes more generous when he has but little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro' fear of being  thought to have little.

>  So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do

> a benevolent man should allow a few defaults in himself to keep his friends in countenance

> Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happened, as by little advantages that occur every day

For someone super organized like Franklin, no doubt that having small things in order leaves a room for lot of time and cognitive space to do more important things. But I confess that at times, I skimmed over parts where too many details of anecdotes were mentioned.

##  The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins

The book's main aim is to explain evolution of life from Gene's perspective.  Personally, the most impactful parts of the book were where Dawkins explains how several aspects of animal behaviour like preference for relatives over others, males' efforts to attract females arise from  genes acting in their selfish interest. On reflection, this makes us feel how strongly evolutionary wiring influences our daily actions and decisions. 

Yet, the book also points out that only we humans are capable of acting against our evolutionary hard wiring. Evolution by giving rise to consciousness in humans made a machine(human), which could understand how it was built. Humans using a contraceptive is an example of an action against the gene's dictatorship. 

> We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators

The chapter on Memes(Mimeme, unit of cultural transmission) explains evolution of life from a cultural perspective. A thought-provoking explanation for questions like why traditions exist?,  how are they passed on from generation to generation?, why some traditions last so long? Somehow the book has left me with the impression that with proper usage of Gene's and/or Meme's point of view, one could explain the reason behind every single human action.

At several places in the book, well-written lines force the reader to pause and ponder its implications in one's own life. When you pick up the book, give the longest pause when you see the below lines.  

> .... When we die there  are two things we can leave behind us: genes and memes. We were built as gene machines, created to  pass on our genes. But that aspect of us will be forgotten in three generations. Your child, even your  grandchild, may bear a resemblance to you, perhaps in facial features, in a talent for music, in the colour of her hair. But as each generation passes, the contribution of your genes is halved. It does not take long  to reach negligible proportions. Our genes may be immortal but the collection of genes that is any one of  us is bound to crumble away. Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of William the Conqueror. Yet it is quite  probable that she bears not a single one of the old king's genes. 
>
> **We should not seek immortality in  reproduction**.  But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking  plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.  **Socrates may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as G. C. Williams has remarked,  but who cares? The meme-complexes of Socrates, Leonardo, Copernicus and Marconi are still going  strong**.

## Life Lessons From Freud by Brett Kahr

Picked this book because "Freud" was in the title.  Essays where some of the interesting Freud's ideas are discussed - relation of filial piety and complacency, Freudian Slips, Freud's respect for patients' privacy, affect of past on the unconscious mind, Freud's theories on jokes and narcissism.  A good book to get introduced to some of Freud's ideas.

## Slaughterhouse 5: The Children's Crusade by Kurt Vonnegut

Things that I loved about this book  - interesting non-linear story narration, neat writing style with lack of pomp and most importantly philosophical lessons about freewill by Tralfamadorians(an alien species).  A classic book that every literature enthusiast ought to read. 

## Amerika by Franz Kafka

This is a Kafka's unfinished novel. I picked up this book with a hope that I might recognize Kafka's genius elements at least in this book. To my disappointment, I could not.  I admit that I dragged myself hard to finish this novel. But it was a good read. 

## Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka

Kafka though never achieved fame during his lifetime continued to write(the works that made Kafka popular are published after his death).  This, I felt is a true sign of love for writing. Hence I started picking up Kafka's books.  Metamorphosis is a short and good read with a simple writing style.  I confess that I couldn't grasp the genius elements of the book.

## Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley

Huxley is a writer with a deadly combination of Scientific knowledge and literary talents. After reading the essay, the reader is forced to think about the question - *do my everyday perception of the outer world reflect reality?*. Our brain filters a lot of sensory inputs as a lot of it is unnecessary for survival purpose. What would happen if you could somehow inhibit the filter in the brain and look at things as they are -**Ding an Sich**. 

## Essays by Orwell

Having read 1984 and Animal Farm, it is difficult to not to be mesmerized by Orwell's simple yet powerful style of writing. The lack of pretense and urge to convey an idea is evident in his essays. Here are the list of the essays that you will enjoy

1.  Why I write
2. Good Bad Books
3. English and Political Language
4. Shooting an Elephant
5. Such, such were the joys
6. Bookshop Memories
7. Confessions of a Book Reviewer
8. Books vs Cigarettes

## Animal Farm by George Orwell

The true genius of Orwell lies in the fact that this book can be read by anyone regardless of age and background and still get the core message - revolution that caused shifting of power from oppressor to oppressed might not necessarily improve conditions; power can corrupt the ideals. 

## Why don't Students like School by Daniel T. Willingham

An excellent book about cognition of learning. Every teacher should be given a physical copy of the book and asked to read it atleast twice. The book not only explains learning from psychological perspective but also provides practical advice in bringing psychological findings into practice.
