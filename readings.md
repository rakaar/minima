##  The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins

The book's main aim is to explain evolution of life from Gene's perspective.  Personally, the most impactful parts of the book were where Dawkins explains how several aspects of animal behaviour like preference for relatives over others, males' efforts to attract females arise from  genes acting in their selfish interest. On reflection, this makes us feel how strongly evolutionary wiring influences our daily actions and decisions. 

Yet, the book also points out that only we humans are capable of acting against our evolutionary hard wiring. Evolution by giving rise to consciousness in humans made a machine(human), which could understand how it was built. Humans using a contraceptive is an example of an action against the gene's dictatorship. 

> We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators

The chapter on Memes(Mimeme, unit of cultural transmission) explains evolution of life from a cultural perspective. A thought-provoking explanation for questions like why traditions exist?,  how are they passed on from generation to generation?, why some traditions last so long? Somehow the book has left me with the impression that with proper usage of Gene's and/or Meme's point of view, one could explain the reason behind every single human action.

At several places in the book, well-written lines force the reader to pause and ponder its implications in one's own life. When you pick up the book, give the longest pause when you see the below lines.  

> .... When we die there  are two things we can leave behind us: genes and memes. We were built as gene machines, created to  pass on our genes. But that aspect of us will be forgotten in three generations. Your child, even your  grandchild, may bear a resemblance to you, perhaps in facial features, in a talent for music, in the colour of her hair. But as each generation passes, the contribution of your genes is halved. It does not take long  to reach negligible proportions. Our genes may be immortal but the collection of genes that is any one of  us is bound to crumble away. Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of William the Conqueror. Yet it is quite  probable that she bears not a single one of the old king's genes. 
>
> **We should not seek immortality in  reproduction**.  But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking  plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool.  **Socrates may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as G. C. Williams has remarked,  but who cares? The meme-complexes of Socrates, Leonardo, Copernicus and Marconi are still going  strong**.

## Life Lessons From Freud by Brett Kahr

Picked this book because "Freud" was in the title.  Essays where some of the interesting Freud's ideas are discussed - relation of filial piety and complacency, Freudian Slips, Freud's respect for patients' privacy, affect of past on the unconscious mind, Freud's theories on jokes and narcissism.  A good book to get introduced to some of Freud's ideas.

## Slaughterhouse 5: The Children's Crusade by Kurt Vonnegut

Things that I loved about this book  - interesting non-linear story narration, neat writing style with lack of pomp and most importantly philosophical lessons about freewill by Tralfamadorians(an alien species).  A classic book that every literature enthusiast ought to read. 

## Amerika by Franz Kafka

This is a Kafka's unfinished novel. I picked up this book with a hope that I might recognize Kafka's genius elements at least in this book. To my disappointment, I could not.  I admit that I dragged myself hard to finish this novel. But it was a good read. 

## Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka

Kafka though never achieved fame during his lifetime continued to write(the works that made Kafka popular are published after his death).  This, I felt is a true sign of love for writing. Hence I started picking up Kafka's books.  Metamorphosis is a short and good read with a simple writing style.  I confess that I couldn't grasp the genius elements of the book.

## Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley

Huxley is a writer with a deadly combination of Scientific knowledge and literary talents. After reading the essay, the reader is forced to think about the question - *do my everyday perception of the outer world reflect reality?*. Our brain filters a lot of sensory inputs as a lot of it is unnecessary for survival purpose. What would happen if you could somehow inhibit the filter in the brain and look at things as they are -**Ding an Sich**. 

## Essays by Orwell

Having read 1984 and Animal Farm, it is difficult to not to be mesmerized by Orwell's simple yet powerful style of writing. The lack of pretense and urge to convey an idea is evident in his essays. Here are the list of the essays that you will enjoy

1.  Why I write
2. Good Bad Books
3. English and Political Language
4. Shooting an Elephant
5. Such, such were the joys
6. Bookshop Memories
7. Confessions of a Book Reviewer
8. Books vs Cigarettes

## Animal Farm by George Orwell

The true genius of Orwell lies in the fact that this book can be read by anyone regardless of age and background and still get the core message - revolution that caused shifting of power from oppressor to oppressed might not necessarily improve conditions; power can corrupt the ideals. 

## Why don't Students like School by Daniel T. Willingham

An excellent book about cognition of learning. Every teacher should be given a physical copy of the book and asked to read it atleast twice. The book not only explains learning from psychological perspective but also provides practical advice in bringing psychological findings into practice.
