# KGP Additional experinence

*There are three kinds of things in life. Things we got to do, things we ought to do, things we like to do. Things we got to do include eating, sleeping, breathing, things that are essential for survival. Things we ought to do are the ones that are expected from us - going to college, behaving properly. Things we like to do are the ones which one should try to maximize in one's life*

Over the last 3 years of my undergraduate life at IIT Kharagpur, I took few additional subjects, which made my academic life interesting. Additional subjects are the extra subjects that you take voluntarily, extra courses one can take apart the compulsory ones required for degree completion(in my case, a degree of Mechanical Engineering). Compulsory subjects come under category of things we ought to do. Additional subjects were the ones that I had liked to do. Without these, I wouldn't have had anything memorable about academics in my college. Here is the list of additionals:

1. HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN COMPLEX PHYSICAL SYSTEMS(CD61004)
2. PHYSICAL COSMOLOGY(PH60307)
3. QUANTUM MECHANICS & QUANTUM COMPUTING(TS70006)
4. COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE(EC60007)
5. INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE INFORMATION PROCESSING(ET60023)
6. NEURONAL CODING OF SENSORY INFORMATION(EC60004)
7. NEUROPHYSIOLOGY(BT41022)
8. NEUROCHEMISTRY(BS60003)
9. INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMS BIOLOGY(BT60006)

In a buffet dinner, you may not enjoy every dish you picked. Similarly, not all additionals I took met my expectations. But few excellent teachers offset the less fulfilling courses. Here is a bit about them.

## Physical Cosmology 

Studying Physical Cosmology under Prof. T.S. Ray was more of an experience than merely doing an academic course. Prof. Ray was a meticulous guy, who had planned the course contents and its structure very well. Despite being an online course, it was close to a blackboard experience due to his setup. 

Remarkably, he covered all concepts of course using Newtonian mechanics. Typically, a professor would keep General theory of relativity(GR) as a pre-requisite and cover physical cosmology using GR concepts. Since many didn't have exposure to GR, he had covered the whole content with Newtonian mechanics for sake of better reach of the subject. A professor putting extra work to make the subject more reachable, is a not a common thing to find. 

Another thing worth mentioning is introduction on the first day of the course. Apart discussing briefly about the logistics, instead of directly getting started with the content, he began technical discussion with the question - *if the universe is infinite filled with stars everywhere, why is the night sky dark*. Most of the courses just begin with the an introduction that is very generic, showing a slide that forcibly tries to convince you that "this thing is everywhere, we ought to know it!".  But Prof. Ray instead began the discussion with a simple curious question, that provokes students to think because the answer is not so straightforward but captures the essence of the course. This technique of introducing the course is another rare thing. One only used to find it in very good Ted Talks. 

## Computational Neuroscience

Around the time, I had taken the course, I had completed reading Godel, Escher, Bach and was reading I am a Strange Loop. Both are popular works of computer scientist and cognitive researcher - Douglas Hofstader, also a man with great art knowledge and excellent writing skills. The single main takeaway of both Hofstadter's books was this - there is a mapping between patterned neuronal activity in brain and things we do. Hofstadter proposes that the complex things we humans  are able to do are because of the complex wiring. He even considers consciousness as result of things complex wiring in the cranium. These books contain such interesting ideas written in a delightful manner. 

I had taken the course - computational neuroscience, just at the right time. The course started with how a single neuron fires these spikes, which are a sudden change in voltage of the neuron. And how this spiking activity encodes stimulus. It was as if the contents of a non-fiction book has been extended to a technical discussion. The course instruction Prof. Sharba also did a good job. Most importantly, he was patient and was ready to repeat things several times and spend time on doubts. This course had solidified my interest in the field of systems neuroscience.   

## Neural Coding of Sensory information

This is another course by Prof. Sharba, who also runs the computational neuroscience course. The theme of this course is how physical stimulus like pixels of light or vibrations are in air are perceived as stimuli. How do vibrations that reach the air give information about the location of sound. How some set of dots on paper can be perceived as a line. It is an interesting idea that you see a common hierarchical pattern the human nervous systems has developed in perceiving different sensory modalities. In hierarchy, the next higher level encodes some complex features. For example, in visual pathway, if a region of brain encodes lines and edges, further regions in the visual hierearchial pathway encode more complex features like faces. Though, the discussion involves lot of biological words - *Medial Geniculate Body* and *Inferior Colliculus*, professor mostly focusses the discussion on mechanism rather than the names,  a nice, rare and important thing.  And also, Prof. Sharba's examinations are open book examination[TODO - many profs can't keep, Chatgpt as this].

## Introduction to Systems Biology

This course was taken by two professors. It was Prof. Riddhiman Dhar, who had made my experience of randomly seleced course name enjoyable. The course had a good title and I learnt from the title that it had something to do with intersection of biology and maths. So, I took to see more of maths in biology, as I had seen in Computational Neuroscience course. Prof. Riddhiman didn't disappoint.  The course discusses modelling of how network of Genes work together. In case of a signal(like a food signal for a bacteria), how different proteins interact and help the bacteria move towards food. Most fascinating part of the course was the discussion of how a gene circuit in bacteria helps the organism to move towards food. A mapping between gene level functioning and macro level behaviour of the organism. Systems neuroscience tries to find a mapping between neural activity and behaviour. But, this was more low-level, A mapping between something inside that runs cells and behaviour. Prof. Riddhiman is a very patient guy and he put both effort and time in clarifying the doubts.   

## Takeway

All exploratory experiences leaving you some learning. From this *additional* experience, there are couple of things I learnt and I think these will stay with me.

**1. Its about the teacher, not the course conent**

Not all the additional subjects were an experience for me. Some of them were exciting, some of them were good, but some of them felt like burden. And things, that I had felt burden are the things that I was excited about the most when I had taken the additional. I used to read text book on my own and try solving exercise problems before I took one of additionals, which turned out to be a burden later. The bottom line is no matter how exciting the content of the course is, it is at the end of the day in the hands of instructor that defines your learning experience during the course. **One can learn more from a good teacher about a boring topic than from a bad teacher about an exciting topic**. Over time, I learnt to also check about the details of instructor other than checking the course contents. Its like you are having a food, that has all the ingridients promised, its just NOT well cooked and makes it eating a horrible experience. 

**2. Good teachers know its means to know**

Unfortunately, in most of the courses, I see that the criteria for completion of the course is know a bunch of popular things done by popular people related to the subject. But very few realise that subtle aspects of understanding things in STEM. All the good experiences that I had mentioned above are cases where the teachers understood that teaching the subject was not just about conveying what things are, but also bothering about why these things matter!

In preface of a popular physics textbook(TODO Resnick halladay name), one of the authors write that the main motivation was question by one of students - *why does any of this matter?*. I am not just mentioning that every topic discussed, should have a practical application. What I suggest is, behind every discovery or idea, there was a motivation of why guy/girl came up with it. Often, these motivations also give a direction of how the problem was solved. Good teachers realise this and one can notice in the introduction they give at the beginning to the lecture. They always talk why any of this matters? This is not just a lesson about courses, but also about the art of learning and communicating[TODO].   

## Why bother taking extra subjects?

My life would have been more peaceful but less exciting, if I had not bothered to take these many additionals alongside the regular curriculum load. I was also asked several times, why I do it? I admit that I was fortunate that six out of 9 additionals were taken, when the semester was running in online mode, where you tend to have more time(time when commute and many social things were off). The time in online semester had given me chance to read wide range of books and choose additionals. But I had continued to do it in offline, though to less extent - taking only one additional instead of two. The key reason for limiting was that I had my master's thesis project in Mechanical Engineering department and I was working on other projects in Dr. Sharba's lab. 

Though the time invested could have been done in other productive things like improving my main Grade or working in an online internship(these could turned out to be new and exciting experiences). But I realised one thing for sure, the majority people when they say, academic courses are not worth the time, don't take it; they are correct most of the time. But with a little homework, by finding good teachers, their courses speak that the academic course system is not that bad as it sounds, its just people make it that way.

## How to choose 

I wasn't aware of even how to find additional subjects until I reached third year. If you are someone from KGP, in ERP portal, check all the subjects that are running this semester. Choose the ones that have interesting names. Enquire about the quality of course instructors' teaching. If the course has pre-requisite, convince the prof. that you know them. Choose one or two such every semester!
