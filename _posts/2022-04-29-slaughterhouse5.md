A fact that is difficult to realise and hard to digest is that we humans lack free will. This was the aim evolutioarily - to produce a illusionary effect of free will. Recently, this realisation struck me again while reading Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5. The protagonist "visits" an alien planet called Tralfamadore, where the species is capable of looking in 4 dimensions - the time dimension in addition to 3 regular spatial dimensions which we see. The Tralfamadorians are capable of looking at a thing's past and future. As described in the book, just as we humans see both the sides of a mountain ranges, they can look into the past and future. 

This means that the Tralfamadorians know what is going to happen to each and everything they see, they know when someone is going to die, they know how the universe is going to end. They reveal that the universe is going to end when a test pilot accidentally presses a button. When Billy asks if there isn't anything that can be done to prevent the pilot from pressing the button. Tralfamadorians reply - *the pilot has always pressed the button and will press the button*. TODO
