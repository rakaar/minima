One of the best things about college life is what are called "clubs" or "societies". A club, in context of college, is a group of like-minded students interested in a particular skill or hobby. You can find clubs for programmers, dancers, western music, eastern music, journalism, robotics, anime enthusiasts. These groups play a key role in an individual's social life and personal development during one's college life. Spent enough time with the group, you not only hone your skills but also make some very close friends. 

But I believe that every such group has a social responsibility of sharing at least the basics of their skill to the rest of the people. Learning something on own requires lot of time, effort, trial and error. With aid of someone who has spent time in the field, the process becomes faster and enjoyable. Though one may not be interested to do that for a long time, but they get a taste of what it is and can appreciate better. 

To put it concretely, clubs should organise activities that help more people get started with something new or may be at least inspire enough to learn more. For example, 

- A programming club can conduct workshops that cover basics of different topics, organise hackathons, share useful resources regularly. 

- A literature club can organise book clubs, conduct seminars explaining famous authors and their works, organise essay writing competitions. 

- A dancers society can conduct workshops to help people get started with some basic moves that they can show off in a party. 

- A music society can conduct seminars explaining theory behind good music, workshops to teach the basics of piano(there are enough piano mobile applications!). 


These are some of the many things that people would like to learn or explore. Of course, you have the internet for everything. But there is a lot on the internet to overwhelm a beginner, and most of the time it is difficult for someone just getting started to sit alone and explore. Instead learning something new in a group from your fellow college mates is an exciting experience. Both the learner and the learnt would feel a great sense of inner satisfaction. A good side effect of these workshops is that it will give people opportunity to come out of their rooms and make new friends while trying something new.

Going out and trying something new is a better way to spend time than being involved in passive activities like watching shows. Learning something new has a potential to give us a change of perspective in life. I believe such activities by these clubs will help the community as a whole to grow and make people happier.
