# Spoilers ahead

All interesting books are alike, but each boring book is boring in its own way. There is no reason to be guilty to acknowledge your hated on this well-acclaimed classic after investing time to read more than 800 pages. 

The book starts out great and gives the vibes of a classic book - a banger opening line, high drama, variety in characters, one scene which changes the course of lives of many characters. But over time, it seems that Tolstoy had forgotten that the title of the book is "Anna Karenina". Some non-fiction work of Tolstoy about Russian agricultural practices, ideas about labour and relation to land,  hunting animals  have accidentally crept in this novel. These parts literally add zero contribution to the story and don't incite any emotion. I know there are people claiming *Anna Karenina is not a mere drama novel, it also gives a sense of how Russia used to be at that time. That's what makes this book an epic, much greater than novel*. I disagree, if one wants to give such feel then that should be integrated smoothly in the story or there could have been a separate essay or a book about his ideas on agriculture. 

Even the supposedly chief character *Anna*, is not a reasonable or likeable character. On repeated instances she behaves in narcissistic way with no concern for people around her. She resolutely refuses divorces and leaves her son with Karenina and elopes to Italy with Vronsky. She doesn't mention her sufferings to Vronsky, instead blames him telling he doesn't love her and on top of that she flirts with Vronsky's friends. She intentionally quarrels with Vronsky on trivial situations. I had anticipated that Anna would be a the story of a matured woman, who fights against society for her love. It is about a narcissistic woman, who wants to prove herself right and believes she is the only one suffering and in turn causes others to suffer! 

I saw a review where he mentions that there is no simple answer to why Anna Karenina commits suicide. Here it is! Anna is a woman who has lost interest in loving Vronsky more(like all shallow emotions that fade away with time) and is sure that she won't be able to see her son because her legal husband Karenin refuses divorce and the giving up the lad.  Her position is society is a defamed one. She had left everything for Vronsky, but now had lost interest in Vronsky. So, having no purpose and emotionally disturbed by the quarrel, she takes up a lot of opium hoping she would die and Vronsky would suffer. But wakes up having a bad trip after Vronsky leaves alone. In the bad trip, she moves to different places including the railway station. Revoking of accident coupled with narcissism in such drugged state, she commits suicide. A long novel doesn't necessarily mean complex emotions!

If you are committed enough to read a  800+ page Russian classic, The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky is a far better option!
